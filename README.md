# old-things

these are my OLD projects. new ones are in their separate repositories.

## old projects list

|project|my notes|
|-|-|
|agmcalc|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmeticâ€“geometric_mean|
|asciigraphengine|used c++. graphs function honestly i forgot what it did. wanted to add polar, maybe will do it later on.|
|collatzchecker|calculates https://oeis.org/A006877|
|complexnumclass|complex number class. wanted to add fancy things like dual complex, splitcomplex, quaternions, octonions, n adic nums. didnt do those, will do in my supercool project im unsure i should make opensource or not.|
|cppminesweeper|first project when i learnt c++.|
|efficientprimecounter|second attempt at primality test, this time python, memory intensive but faster than couple optimizations combined.|
|eyetest|got new glasses and decided which one could i see better in. ABSOLUTELY 0 reason this should have been ever created.|
|filebinaryreverser|i wanted to save up on space with zip files, so i thought maybe reversing would help compress it better. that wasnt the case but the program was very solid. gpt wrote it though.|
|infdigitdatatype|i hated integer limits. i learnt of datastructures. wanted to use 10 bits to define digits 0-999 only loss would be 1000-1024. found out it was bytes. also didnt define operations i think.|
|primechecker|prime checker written in C. optimised, extremely verbose, first meaningful program i wrote after learning c, could be done better.|
|webpkiller|kill the pesky .webp files and convert them into our glorious .png files in bulk. gpt written code. but small code. had to share because its universally useful.|

## things i didnt include here, but are projects i did.

|project|my notes|
|-|-|
|boat sensor intership|privated repo for security. if you miss my documentation, check out github.com/RalphBacon/LGT8F328P-Arduino-Clone-Chip-ATMega328P?tab=readme-ov-file#6-simple-steps-to-get-a-lgt8f328p-based-board-running-at-32mhz|
|cognitive maxxing|was a mind gauntlet kind of things with many things to test your mental capabilities on, like testing how many days passed since some time or multiplying large integers. modules reused variables and the code got too dirty.|
|challenging operation practice|legacy cognitive maxxing|
|day calc on python|i keep list of dates on things, what will happen, what has happened. helps me alot to keep track of time and anniversaries. but ultimately is gpt written code.|
|duplicate file finder|gpt written code. searches for duplicate files, used it to remove duplicates from my gallery.|
|equation solving programs|who cares|
|file renamer|i used to be a youtube mp3 converter music listening guy. the site appended extra text to the names and i removed it using a python script.|
|game maker projects|i did games and visuals, most of the games music, sprites, objectives suck due to being made without plans. i didnt learn global and local variable concept for long which made it significantly worse for my games.|
|hollow knight knapsack|i learnt of knapsack on school. in the game hollow knight, theres "charms" which are placed on slots. charms take different amount of slots. so i modified knapsack algo a bit and calculated the number of combinations which is 1194813. tried to port it into my website converting it to javascript from python but i failed and didnt care, it was like the only thing on my website.|
|html stuff from middleschool|i found out files could be linked and did somewhat complex websites, as a middleschooler i had 0 idea what css or js meant.|
|image categoriser|gpt written code, i used it to categorise my gallery a few times. its highly personalised code and i decided to go with a tags approach rather than a folder approach because images may fit to multiple categories.|
|lambert omega calc|is calculator for an amazing function. that function allows for amazing simplifications and provides answers for some transcendental equations. i like knowing about that obscure thing only myself. is cool, if you are curious go check it out yourself, also practice it.|
|level program|i still use it. it can partition your work or give you xp and did gamify tasks on whatever you did. is in my language and does have menu to do two things. imagine giving people a program that does two separate things.|
|logarithm finder|finds ln values of integers in given numerator and denominator range, outputs most effective one, useful for calculating fractional exponents from mind|
|mandelbrot|how original! also uses that ascii graph "engine". id rather learn graphical programming and redo it.|
|minecraft commands from middleschool|command blocks in minecraft are used to modify world data etc. you can summon entities using them. you can summon entities riding entities. falling blocks are counted as entities. one command block can summon many others to create complicated things, and commands have coding (kinda declarative) syntax. can count it my first coding experience maybe.|
|minecraft mods|i did many cool mods, some were large, heard of an user drawing a vanilla texture by themselves and getting rewarded a cape. i had vanilla textures edited by hand or adjusted mixed on all my mods. decided its most ethical to rely on art one creates. its all halted. i may make more minecraft mods later on. ALSO IF ANYONE SEES THIS, I AM LOCKED BEHIND NOT UNDERSTANDING COPYRIGHT AND PROTECTING YOUR WORK. WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS, HOW TO BRAND MY OWN WORK? THIS IS A BIG SHACKLE TO MY CREATIVE FREEDOM. WHERE DO I WALK.|
|mods for other games|i had small mods made on terraria, need for speed mw, dredge, and some couple of other games. i never shared because they are small games anyways. also i am unsure of rights things. i used dnspy, resource hacker, assets changing, hex editing, xml editing etc.|
|randomrangeincreaser|random() function range increased. i called it an engine. it sucks.|
|roblox stuff from middleschool|there was like properties tab and i could edit things. i dont find roblox educative today, sure theres luascript now but i remember reading about roblox being not too respectful with your creations so that a demotivator.|
|romannumerals|roman numeral translator which would be better if it was written in python instead of c|
|simulating other color spaces on rgb led w arduino|school project, teacher loved it and offered job. had constraints, i only had limited electronics supplies, and could deliver even if that was the case. its already in its own repo|
|string rule programs|caesar cipher and shift things. another one will turn ace->bd ae->c ac->b and so on, reducing str len by 1 and finding middles. i had SO much trouble finding some good name on a minecraft mod i was making on something between two materials that i considered this. which sucked.|
|sudoku solver|i am not the best sudoku solver myself, there were like lots of algorithms which i felt lazy and didnt implement. the way i defined the board was weird, defined it as an 3x3x3 array|
|web scraper|i used web scrapers made in python with help of gpt to find cool github nicks, i provided my friends with those. i think its not too ethical. so i wont use or provide code for it till im sure.|
|wifi connection test|i had a fried wifi card on my old laptop. this program would show connection cuts for troubleshooting. that card is the problem. it probably has a resistor or capacitor burnt or something idk.|
